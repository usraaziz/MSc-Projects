# MSc-Projects

This repository contains different projects throughout my MSc course

1. Big Data Project: A Jupyter Notebook detailing experiments with Spark and Google Cloud (GC) for scalable big data processing tasks and a comprehensive report documenting experiments and findings related to big data analysis and cloud computing performance.

Skills Demonstrated:
Big Data Processing: Use of PySpark and Google Cloud (GC) for scalable data processing.
Cluster Configuration: Experimentation with single and multi-node clusters to optimize resource allocation and throughput.
Parallelization Techniques: Leveraged Spark RDDs for preprocessing tasks such as resizing, cropping, and generating TFRecords for images.
Performance Analysis: Evaluated throughput, CPU utilization, and network/disk metrics for various configurations.
Data Caching: Implemented caching mechanisms to optimize Spark jobs for repeated data access.

2. INFO_CW_FINAL!!.docx: This document evaluates search strategies and results for identifying relevant information on adolescent and teen depression. It explores the use of various search services and query types.

Skills Demonstrated:

Search Strategy Development: Utilised PICO framework for structured facet analysis to inform search queries.
Boolean and Ranking Queries: Designed and optimized queries using Boolean operators, wildcards, and proximity operators for precise search results.
Evaluation and Metrics Analysis: Assessed search performance with metrics like precision (P@5, P@10, AveP) and identified duplicates, spam, and broken links.
Search Engine Comparison: Conducted comparative analysis across search services (Google, Bing, YouTube, ProQuest, etc.) to determine effectiveness.
Iterative Query Refinement: Iteratively adjusted queries to improve relevance, addressing issues such as ambiguity and irrelevant results.
Critical Analysis: Identified limitations and proposed future improvements, such as the use of filters and Boolean NOT operators for better precision.
