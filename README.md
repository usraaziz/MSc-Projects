# MSc-Projects

This repository contains different projects throughout my MSc course

1. Big Data Project- A Jupyter Notebook detailing experiments with Spark and Google Cloud (GC) for scalable big data processing tasks and a comprehensive report documenting experiments and findings related to big data analysis and cloud computing performance. Skills demonstrated in this project are Big Data Processing by the Utilisation of PySpark and GC for handling large-scale datasets, Cluster Configuration through testing single and multi-node clusters to maximise resource efficiency, Parallelization Techniques through employing Spark RDDs for image data preprocessing, including resizing, cropping, and generating TFRecords, Performance Analysis by measuring and analysing throughput, CPU utilization, and network/disk metrics for various configurations and Data Caching by implementing caching mechanisms to improve job efficiency and resource utilisation.
